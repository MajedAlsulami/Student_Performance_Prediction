#  Student Performance Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts students’ exam scores based on academic, behavioral, and productivity-related features.  
The project applies multiple regression models and compares their performance to select the best-performing algorithm.

---

##  Overview

This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using supervised machine learning techniques.

We:

- Performed data preprocessing  
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Applied feature selection  
- Trained multiple regression models  
- Compared performance using evaluation metrics  
- Analyzed feature importance  

The goal is to identify the most impactful factors affecting student exam scores and build a high-performing predictive model.

##  Technical Highlights

- Regression-based ML modeling  
- K-Fold Cross Validation  
- Model comparison using R² Score, MAE, and MSE  
- Feature importance analysis using Random Forest  
- Data preprocessing including:
  - Handling missing values  
  - Removing misleading values  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Feature scaling

##  Dataset

Dataset downloaded from Kaggle: [student-performance-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amar5693/student-performance-dataset)


File used:

```
ultimate_student_productivity_dataset_5000.csv
```

###  Target Variable

```
exam_score
```

###  Example Features

- Gender  
- Academic level  
- Internet quality  
- Productivity score  
- Study-related attributes  

### Data Cleaning Included

- Removing misleading values (e.g., "other" in gender column)  
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  

---

##  Analysis Workflow

### 1️ Data Loading

- Dataset downloaded using KaggleHub  
- Loaded into Pandas DataFrame  

### 2️ Data Cleaning

- Checked duplicates  
- Checked missing values  
- Removed misleading categorical entries  

### 3️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Target distribution visualization  
- Statistical summaries  
- Feature inspection  

### 4️ Feature Engineering

- Label encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling numerical features (MinMaxScaler)  

### 5️ Model Training

Models used:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- LightGBM Regressor  
- CatBoost Regressor  

Used:

- K-Fold Cross Validation  

### 6️ Model Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics:

- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

 Since R² was used for comparison:

Higher R² score = Better performance

### 7️ Best Model

 Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest R² score.

##  Key Features

- Multiple model comparison  
- Proper preprocessing pipeline  
- Cross-validation for reliable evaluation  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Clear visualization of results

##  Feature Importance

Using Random Forest:

`productivity_score` was identified as the most important feature.

This indicates that productivity-related behaviors strongly influence exam performance.
